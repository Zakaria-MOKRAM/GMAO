Project Design
The design of the GMAO application was driven by a structured UML analysis approach

The GMAO (Gestion de la Maintenance Assist√©e par Ordinateur) project is a software solution developed as part of a professional internship at AGIWISE, a digital services company. This project aims to optimize maintenance management processes by providing a platform for tracking equipment, scheduling preventive maintenance, and managing work orders. It is designed to serve various industries and platforms, making it adaptable to diverse operational environments
Class Diagrams: These define the relationships and structures of different system entities, from maintenance tasks to equipment logs and users.
Use Case Diagrams: These map out the interactions between users (e.g., technicians, managers) and the system, ensuring that all functional requirements are met.
System Architecture: A multi-tier architecture was adopted, separating business logic, data access, and user interface layers, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

Agile Methodology with Scrum
To manage the complexity of the project, we adopted the Scrum framework, an Agile development methodology. Scrum helped in breaking down the project into manageable sprints, ensuring continuous delivery and flexibility to adapt to changes. Regular sprint reviews and daily stand-ups facilitated communication within the team, while Jira was used for managing backlogs, assigning tasks, and tracking progress.

Each sprint focused on delivering functional modules, such as equipment management, scheduling, and reporting, ensuring that the project was delivered on time and within scope.

Technologies Used
The GMAO application was built using a robust tech stack to ensure efficiency, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility

Backend: Spring Boot, providing a strong and flexible backend architecture.<br/>
Frontend: Thymeleaf, integrated with Spring Boot to create dynamic web pages.<br/>
Database: SQL Server, hosted in a Docker container for better deployment flexibility.<br/>
IDE: IntelliJ was used to streamline the development process.<br/>
Jira Integration: Jira API was employed for issue tracking, ensuring smooth collaboration and task management between team members.<br/>
Docker containerization enabled easier deployment and version control, while the use of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf ensured smooth, responsive, and scalable web development.
